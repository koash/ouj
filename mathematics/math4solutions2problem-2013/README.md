# 1st: Solution to the problem by the mathematical approach

## What is Mathematical Modeling?
- Mathematical Modeling: The model mentioned mathematically
- Modeling: Target interested to simplify and expressed the essence
- Understanding of a target and prediction of a phenomenon

## Various Mathematical Methods
- Differential equation, partial differential equation
- Establishment, statistics
- Equation, inequality
- Graph

## A mathematics model: Combined gas law in ideal gas
- P: Pressure
- V: Volume
- T: Absolute temperature
- n: Gaseous molar number
- R: Gas constant

```
PV = nRT
```
